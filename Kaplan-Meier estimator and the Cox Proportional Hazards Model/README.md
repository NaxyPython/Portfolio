**Survival Analysis of HIV Patients Using Kaplan-Meier and Cox Proportional Hazards Model with SAS and Python**  

---

### **1. Introduction**  
This project focuses on **survival analysis** of HIV patients to determine the impact of treatment, age, and other covariates on survival time.  

The study uses two approaches:  
1. **SAS** for survival analysis with Kaplan-Meier estimation and the Cox regression model.  
2. **Python** (with libraries like `pandas`, `lifelines`, and `matplotlib`) to replicate the same analyses and provide additional visualizations.  

By showcasing these two tools, this project demonstrates proficiency in both **statistical programming** languages for survival analysis.

### **2. Objective**  

The goals of this project are:  
1. **Data Preparation**: Clean the dataset and ensure it aligns with analysis requirements.  
2. **Kaplan-Meier Analysis**: Compare survival curves:  
   - By treatment groups.  
   - By age groups (quartiles).  
3. **Cox Proportional Hazards Model**: Identify significant predictors of survival time.  
4. **Versatile Implementation**: Implement the analyses using both **SAS** and **Python** to showcase reproducibility.

### **3. Dataset Description**  

The dataset includes the following variables:

| **Variable**   | **Description**                             | **Values**                     |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `id`          | Identification Code                         | 1–1156                         |
| `time`        | Time to AIDS diagnosis or death (days)      | Numeric                        |
| `censor`      | Event indicator for AIDS or death           | 1 = Yes, 0 = No                |
| `tx`          | Treatment group                             | 1 = IDV, 0 = Control           |
| `sex`         | Sex of patient                              | 1 = Male, 2 = Female           |
| `cd4`         | Baseline CD4 count (cells/milliliter)       | Numeric                        |
| `priozdv`     | Months of prior ZDV use                     | Numeric                        |
| `age`         | Age at enrollment                           | Numeric                        |

### **4. Methodology**  

#### **Step 1: Data Cleaning**  
- **SAS**: Use `DATA` steps to filter out patients with **CD4 ≤ 200** and prior ZDV use < 3 months.  
- **Python**: Use `pandas` for the same filtering and column renaming for clarity.  

#### **Step 2: Kaplan-Meier Analysis**  
- Compare survival probabilities:  
   - **By treatment** (`tx`).  
   - **By age groups** (created using quartiles).  
- **SAS**: Use `PROC LIFETEST`.  
- **Python**: Use the `KaplanMeierFitter` from `lifelines`.

#### **Step 3: Cox Proportional Hazards Model**  
- Fit a Cox regression model to determine significant covariates:  
   - Treatment (`tx`), Sex (`sex`), Age (`age`), CD4 count (`cd4`), and Prior ZDV use (`priozdv`).  
- **SAS**: Use `PROC PHREG`.  
- **Python**: Use the `CoxPHFitter` from `lifelines`.

#### **Step 4: Results Comparison**  
- Generate and compare results (survival curves, hazard ratios) between SAS and Python outputs.

### **5. Tools and Techniques**  

- **SAS**:  
   - `PROC IMPORT` for data loading.  
   - `PROC LIFETEST` for Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.  
   - `PROC PHREG` for Cox regression modeling.  

- **Python**:  
   - `pandas` for data manipulation.  
   - `lifelines` for Kaplan-Meier and Cox models.  
   - `matplotlib` for visualization.

### **6. Project Results**  

#### **Kaplan-Meier Survival Analysis**  
- **Treatment Group Comparison**:  
   - The survival probability for the **IDV group** is higher than the control group.  
- **Age Group Comparison**:  
   - Younger patients (Q1 and Q2) exhibit better survival probabilities than older groups (Q3 and Q4).

#### **Cox Regression Model**  
- Significant covariates influencing survival:  
   - **Treatment** (positive impact on survival).  
   - **Baseline CD4 count** (higher values reduce risk).  
   - **Age** (older patients have an increased hazard).
